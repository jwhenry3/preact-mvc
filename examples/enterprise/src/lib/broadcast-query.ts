/**
 * Cross-thread query cache sync, KEY-SCOPED. TanStack's v4
 * broadcastQueryClient plugin was removed in v5 (persist-client-core
 * takes a generic AsyncStorage, not a channel), so this recreates the
 * same idea by hand — but syncs only the keys each context declares:
 *
 * - PUBLISH: on a cache event, only the changed query is dehydrated
 *   (delta, not the whole cache), and only when its key matches `keys`.
 * - ACCEPT: incoming state is filtered to the same `keys` before
 *   hydrate(), so a context never materializes a cache it doesn't read.
 *
 * BroadcastChannel natively spans the main thread and workers on one
 * origin, so no island plumbing is needed for the cache.
 *
 * The `hydrating` flag breaks the echo loop: hydrate() fires cache
 * events, which the subscriber would otherwise rebroadcast forever.
 * BroadcastChannel never delivers a message to its sender, so the flag
 * is only needed on the receive path.
 *
 * Call once per QueryClient (shell AND worker). Returns teardown.
