/**
 * Shared worker-side provider spine for the per-page workers. Each page
 * worker gets its own FakeApi + QueryClient — separate instances, so a
 * heavy page can't stall a sibling's renders. BroadcastChannel syncs only
 * SHARED_QUERY_KEYS between contexts; a worker's page-local queries never
 * copy into sibling heaps.
 *
 * ThemeService stays on the main thread — it needs document/matchMedia —
 * and arrives as props.
