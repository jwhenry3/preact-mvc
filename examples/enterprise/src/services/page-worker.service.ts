/**
 * The worker host for worker-rendered routed pages (dashboard, users,
 * settings, components): one dedicated worker + client PER PAGE.
 * `clientFor(app)` lazily connects the page's worker on first navigation
 * and keeps it alive for the session — the page's worker-side caches
 * survive route swaps, and a heavy page can't stall a sibling's renders
 * because they live on separate threads. Every client terminates with the
 * app scope.
 *
 * Every client connects with `keepAlive`: navigating away unmounts the
 * page instance (lifecycle stops — timers, observers, ops all go down)
 * but the worker thread stays resident and idle, so navigating back is a
 * warm start on a live thread with its module graph and QueryClient
 * already loaded — no respawn, no re-init. The clients double as lazy
 * loaders: a page's bundle only evaluates when its worker first spawns,
 * and its data caches stay warm for the session. All threads still die
 * with the app scope via the DestroyRef teardown below.
 *
 * The dashboard worker hosts the whole page; its chart and ticker islands
 * spawn nested sub-workers from inside it (chart.worker, ticker.worker).
 *
 * The URL literals inside new Worker(...) stay bundler-detectable — do
 * not hoist or compute them.
