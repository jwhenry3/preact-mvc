/**
 * `@preact-mvc/atoll-island` — the `*-island` package's shell surface
 * (docs/atoll/islands-frameworks.md): mount a worker-hosted island tree as
 * an ordinary element in a preact-mvc app. The worker-side renderer
 * (viewIslandApp, defineViewPolyWorker) lives in the `./worker` entry.
 *
 * The facade pattern: a contract module (`defineIslandContract`) names the
 * app, declares the wire schemas, and carries the worker factory — the
 * view imports the contract only and mounts `islandComponent(contract)`
 * with no worker plumbing at the call site.
 *
 * The driver/mount API is re-exported from `@preact-mvc/atoll` so shell
 * code only needs this one package.
