/**
 * `@preact-mvc/atoll` shell surface — a thin facade over `@atolljs/islands`
 * (docs/atoll/islands.md). The op protocol, proxy DOM, instance lifecycle,
 * and op-replay driver are the real package now; this file only normalizes
 * the worker option (an already-created WorkerLike counts as an entry, the
 * real package wants a bundler-detectable factory or URL) and defaults the
 * transport to message-only so mounts work without COOP/COEP headers —
 * GitHub Pages can't serve them.
 *
 * Push mode still works: pass `mode: 'push'` on a `worker:` mount (builds a
 * doorbell client) or `doorbell: true` on `connectIslandWorker`, and serve
 * Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin + Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy:
 * require-corp.
